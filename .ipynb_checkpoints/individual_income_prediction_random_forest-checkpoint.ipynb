    "### Individual Income Prediction Using Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The most powerful tool for reducing decision tree overfitting is called the random forest algorithm. In this mission, we'll learn how to construct and apply random forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We'll use the same 1994 census data set on U.S. income. It contains information on marital status, age, type of work, and more. The target column, high_income, records salaries less than or equal to 50k a year (0), and more than 50k a year (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A random forest is a kind of ensemble model. Ensembles combine the predictions of multiple models to create a more accurate final prediction. We'll make a simple ensemble to see how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let's create two decision trees with slightly different parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - One with min_samples_leaf set to 2\n",
    "   - One with max_depth set to 5\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Then, we'll check their accuracies separately. Next, we'll combine their predictions and compare the combined accuracy with the individual accuracies of both trees."

Although each individual decision tree in a random forest varies widely, the average of their predictions is less sensitive to the input data than a single tree is. This is because while one tree can construct an incorrect and overfit model, the average of 100 or more trees will be more likely to hone in on the signal and ignore the noise. The signal will be the same across all of the trees, whereas each tree will hone in on the noise differently. This means that the average will discard the noise and keep the signal."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### While the random forest algorithm is incredibly powerful, it isn't applicable to all tasks. The main strengths of a random forest are:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Very accurate predictions - Random forests achieve near state-of-the-art performance on many machine learning tasks. Along with neural networks and gradient-boosted trees, they're typically one of the top-performing algorithms.\n",
    "   - Resistance to overfitting - Due to their construction, random forests are fairly resistant to overfitting. We still need to set and tweak parameters like max_depth though.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The main weaknesses of using a random forest are:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - They're difficult to interpret - Because we've averaging the results of many trees, it can be hard to figure out why a random forest is making predictions the way it is.\n",
    "   - They take longer to create - Making two trees takes twice as long as making one, making three takes three times as long, and so on. Fortunately, we can exploit multicore processors to parallelize tree construction. Scikit allows us to do this through the n_jobs parameter on RandomForestClassifier. We'll discuss parallelization in greater detail later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Given these trade-offs, it makes sense to use random forests in situations where accuracy is of the utmost importance; being able to interpret or explain the decisions the model is making isn't key. In cases where time is of the essence or interpretability is important, a single decision tree may be a better choice."
